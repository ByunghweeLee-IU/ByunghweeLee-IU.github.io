      <h1>Hi, I'm Byunghwee Lee (이병휘)!</h1>
      <p>
        I serve as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, working with Jisun An, Haewoon Kwak, and Yong-Yeol Ahn. His work primarily focuses on data science applications in the fields of cultural analytics, computational social science, and human belief dynamics. His research spans multiple disciplines, merging theoretical concepts from statistical physics with computational techniques like natural language processing (NLP), 
        image processing, and machine learning, supported by extensive computing power.
      </p> 
      <p>
        I earned his Ph.D. in physics from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). During his time at KAIST, he developed a robust interdisciplinary career, examining society, culture, and art through the lens of statistical physics and complex network science. His seminal work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), employed information theory to analyze the evolution of landscape art compositions. This innovative approach gained recognition in major media outlets, including Forbes and Cosmos magazine, and was featured in a PNAS commentary, underscoring the integration of complex scientific methods with extensive art historical data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, My research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to examine complex human behaviors on digital platforms. His recent studies employ LLMs to represent the intricate relationships between various human beliefs. These belief embeddings help predict an individual's new beliefs and uncover underlying mechanisms in belief formation. His findings demonstrate how LLMs, combined with aggregated online data, can illuminate the processes of human belief formation and decision-making.

        I am open to collaborations and can be reached at bl46@iu.edu.
